<p>This property contains more information about the dataset as a brief, free-text description. It is used only for a brief overview, because free-text fields are unsuitable for searches, due to spelling mistakes, different wordings and other aspects. The categorisation and other aspects about the dataset are described within other properties of the dataset. </p>
<p>This property can be repeated for parallel language versions of the description - see <a class="no-secRef" href="#accessibility-and-multilingual-aspects"></a>. The language versions should correspond to property <a href="#catalogue-record-language"><code>dct:language</code></a> of class Catalogue Record. I.e., if more than one language is provided as a metadata language, there should be as many language versions for the description.</p>

<p>This property links the dataset to an available distribution.</p> 
<p>In mobilityDCAT-AP, it is mandatory that each dataset has at least one distribution. Thus, the obligation of this property is raised to “mandatory”, compared to [[DCAT-AP-v2.0.1]].</p>

<p><code>dct:Frequency</code></p>
</td>

<p>This property describes how often the delivered content is updated. This information tells a data consumer, how often it is updated on the on the data platform, so the data consumer might align the frequency of data retrieval accordingly. </p>
<p>For data services, e.g., data feeds, the frequency should correspond to the technical upload / data push frequency. For static datasets, it should correspond to the expected change frequency (see property <a href="#dataset-modification-date"><code>dct:modified</code></a>). The frequency might be a specific time interval, or a general remark such as “updated on occurrence”. A controlled vocabulary <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#controlled-vocabularies-to-be-used"></a> is provided.</p>

<p><code>skos:Concept</code></p>
</td>

<p>This property refers to the mobility-related theme (i.e., a specific subject, category, or type) of the delivered content.  A dataset may be associated with multiple themes. A theme is important for data seekers who are interested in a particular type of data content.</p>
<p>The theme is described via a controlled vocabulary in two hierarchy levels: The 1st level is a mandatory field labelled "Data content category", describing the classification of the data content on an aggregated level. The 2nd level is an optional field labelled “Data content sub category”, detailing the "Data content category" via one or several sub-categories. When entering the metadata for one dataset, the data provider would first select one or several options of a "Data content category", and then optionally details this with one or more options of corresponding “Data content sub category”. The platform must be able to handle the dependencies between these two levels, i.e., match the allowed options between the 1st and 2nd level.</p>
<p>The corresponding controlled vocabulary <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#controlled-vocabularies-to-be-used"></a> is provided.</p>
<p>This property is a sub-property of <a href="#dataset-category"><code>dcat:theme</code></a>, which is also a further, recommended property of Dataset. To distinguish the both theme properties, it is recommended to label <code>mobilitydcatap:mobilityTheme</code> as "Mobility Theme", and <code>dcat:theme</code> as "EU Open Data Theme".</p>  
<p>The subject of a dataset MAY also be described via a property <a href="#dataset-keyword"><code>dcat:keyword</code></a>. However, the usage of "mobility theme" is preferred, to avoid ambiguity and uncontrolled theme descriptions.</p>

<p>This property refers to a geographic region that is covered by the delivered content.</p>
<p>There are different options how to describe the geographic region under the class Location, see <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#properties-for-location"></a>. One of these options MUST be used, as the geographic reference is essential for data seekers.</p>

<p>This property can be repeated for parallel language versions of the name - see <a class="no-secRef" href="#accessibility-and-multilingual-aspects"></a>.The language versions should correspond to property <a href="#catalogue-record-language"><code>dct:language</code></a> of class Catalogue Record.

<p>This property refers to an entity (company and person) that publishes the corresponding dataset. This entity is responsible for the provisioning of a dataset. The entity also concludes a contract, if applicable.</p>
<p>This information can be natively created by a data platform, then corresponding to the entity that is registered to the data platform and has the role of a data publisher. This information can be also harvested from other portals. The information might be identical to the property <a href="#catalogue-record-publisher"><code>dct:publisher</code></a> of class Catalogue Record and/or <a href="#dataset-rights-holder"><code>dct:rightsHolder</code></a> of class Dataset. </p>
<p>The obligation of this property is raised to “mandatory”, compared to [[DCAT-AP-v2.0.1]].</p>
<p>To establish a contact with a company or person responsible for the datase, the recommended property <a href="#dataset-contact-point"><code>dcat:contactPoint</code></a> SHOULD be used.</p>
