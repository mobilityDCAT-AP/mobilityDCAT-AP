# mobilityDCAT-AP

This is the issue tracker for the maintenance of [mobilityDCAT-AP](https://napcore.eu/providing-a-baseline-for-a-new-metadata-scheme-for-european-naps/).

mobilityDCAT-AP is an extension of [DCAT-AP](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/solution/dcat-application-profile-data-portals-europe) for describing mobility datasets, dataset series, and services. It provides an RDF syntax binding for the union of metadata elements defined in the National Access Points across Europe. Its basic use case is to make mobility datasets, data series, and services searchable on general data portals, thereby making mobility information better searchable across borders and sectors.

mobilityDCAT-AP is an initiative of the [NAPCORE (National Access Point Coordination Organisation for Europe)](https://napcore.eu/), a formed organisation to coordinate and harmonise more than 30 mobility data platforms across Europe.

The latest version of mobilityDCAT-AP (v1.0) is available:

[https://https://w3id.org/mobilitydcatap/releases/](https://https://w3id.org/mobilitydcatap/releases/)

Any problems encountered, or suggestions for new functionalities can be submitted as [issues on the mobilityDCAT-AP repository on GitHub](https://github.com/mobilityDCAT-AP/mobilityDCAT-AP/issues). A short guideline for submitting issues can be found at [SEMICeu/DCAT-AP/wiki/Submission-guidelines](https://github.com/SEMICeu/DCAT-AP/wiki/Submission-guidelines).

*The mobilityDCAT-AP specification does not replace the [INSPIRE Metadata Regulation](http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2008/1205) nor the [INSPIRE Metadata technical guidelines based on ISO 19115 and ISO 19119](https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/id/document/tg/metadata-iso19139). Its purpose is give owners of geospatial metadata the possibility to achieve more by providing an additional RDF syntax binding.*

## Structure of the repository

[//]: # ([Releases](./releases/): mobilityDCAT-AP releases (1.0, etc.); each release might have different distributions.)
- [Working Drafts](./drafts/): Working drafts including revisions to the latest mobilityDCAT-AP release.

## Implementations

- [GeoDCAT-AP XSLT & API](https://github.com/SEMICeu/iso-19139-to-dcat-ap): Reference XSLT-based implementation and API
- [CSW-4-Web](https://github.com/SEMICeu/csw-4-web): A proof-of-concept API to expose CSW endpoints in a Web-friendly way, making use of an extended and ad hoc version of the GeoDCAT-AP XSLT & API.
- [EPSG to RDF XSLT](https://github.com/SEMICeu/epsg-to-rdf): Proof of concept for the RDF representation of the [OGC EPSG register of coordinate reference systems](http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/), extending the RDF mappings for reference systems defined in GeoDCAT-AP.

Additional mobilityDCAT-AP implementations are documented in the [dedicated page on Joinup](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/semantic-interoperability-community-semic/solution/geodcat-application-profile-data-portals-europe/document/geodcat-ap-implementations).
